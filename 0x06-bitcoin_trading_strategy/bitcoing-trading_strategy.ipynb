    "- The idea is to predict when to buy or sell bitcoin. We define buy or sell signal and represent them as 1 or 0. We arrive at the signal by comparing the price trend of short-term and long-term behavior, that is, short-term moving average greater than a long-term moving average. Then we buy bitcoin; otherwise, we sell bitcoin. This is, therefore, a classification problem where we are interested in getting the direction of Bitcoin movement right. "
