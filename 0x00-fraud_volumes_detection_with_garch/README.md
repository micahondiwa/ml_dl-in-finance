**ABSTRACT**

Electronic transaction fraud has been on the increase in recent times. Though technology advancement is cited as a major milestone in the global business environment, at times, it comes with challenges, such as financial risks. Businesses and individuals have been losing their hard-earned funds through online-related transaction frauds, and the trend continues to increase. Studies reviewed heavily used deep learning and machine learning to  investigate  the  detection  of  online-related fraudulent  activities.  The  current  study, however, deviated from this norm by focusing on modelling electronic transaction fraud volumes using the Generalised Auto-regressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (GARCH) model.   The   study   employed   grid   search   cross-validation   parameter   optimisation techniques  and  popular  loss  functions,  includingMean  Absolute  Error  (MAE),  Root Mean   Square   Error   (RMSE),   Akaike   Information   Criterion   (AIC),   and   Bayesian Information  Criterion  (BIC)  to  find  the  best-fitting  model.  The  study  objective  was  to establish a suitable model for forecasting changes (Variations) in the volume of money lost from fraudulent transactions in Kenya. The study is anchored on the fraud triangle model and fraud diamond model. The study revealed thatGARCH (1,1) model predicts electronic transaction fraud volume deviations in Kenya; with the prediction, the risk of financial losses can be averted. This study is important to stakeholders such as the public, corporations, regulators such as the Central Bank of Kenya, financial institutions such as commercial banks, and scholars.
