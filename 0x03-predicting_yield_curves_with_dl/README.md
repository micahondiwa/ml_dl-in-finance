# APPLICATION OF DEEP LEARNING IN PREDICTING YIELD CURVES

- Yield curve is a graph showing interest rates (bonds) having different maturities.

  
**Project Goal:** To find and understand the factors that affect movements pf yield curve.

- Among the variables are the historical data of the yield curve, federal debt percentage that is held by the investors, and the corporate bond.
- The dependent variable will be the 1-month, 5-year and 30-year tenure of the yield curve.
- Data sources are FRED and Yahoo websites.
